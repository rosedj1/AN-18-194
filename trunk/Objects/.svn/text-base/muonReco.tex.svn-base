More details on muon reconstruction can be found in Ref.~\cite{AN-15-277}.
We define {\bf loose muons} as the muons that satisfy  
$p_T > 5$, $|\eta| < 2.4$, $dxy< 0.5$, $dz < 1$, where $dxy$ and $dz$ are 
defined w.r.t. the PV and using the 'muonBestTrack'. Muons have to be 
reconstructed by either the Global Muon or Tracker Muon algorithm. Standalone 
Muon tracks that are only reconstructed in the muon system are rejected.
Muons with \verb|muonBestTrackType==2| (standalone) are discarded even if they 
are marked as global or tracker muons. 

Loose muons with $\pt$ below 200\GeV are considered {\bf tight muons} if they 
also pass the PF muon ID (note that the naming 
convention used for these IDs differs from the muon POG naming scheme, in which
the ``tight ID'' used here is called the ``loose ID''). Loose muons with $\pt$ 
above 200\GeV are considered tight muons if they pass the PF ID or the Tracker
High-$\pt$ ID, the definition of which is shown in Table~\ref{tab:highPtID}.
This relaxed definition is used to increase signal efficiency for the high-mass
search. When a very heavy resonance decays to two $\cPZ$ bosons, both bosons
will be very boosted. In the lab frame, the leptons coming from the decay of
a highly boosted $\cPZ$ will be nearly collinear, and the PF ID loses 
efficiency for muons separated by approximately $\Delta R < 0.4$, which roughly 
corresponds to muons originating from $\cPZ$ bosons with $\pt > 500\GeV$.

An additional ``ghost-cleaning'' step is performed to deal with situations when a single muon
can be incorrectly reconstructed as two or more muons:

\begin{itemize}

\item Tracker Muons that are not Global Muons are required to be arbitrated.
\item If two muons are sharing 50\% or more of their segments then the muon with lower quality is removed.

\end{itemize}
